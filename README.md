## Hi Community, ##

I am Allen Wang, a product designer and currently learning Swift.

This project was totally inspired by [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) project, after read his [Medium post](https://medium.com/@samvlu/100-days-of-swift-736d45a19b63#.ayz5vx6mc) I made a decision to put my every single day to write swift, this's the final code of 30 tiny swift projects.

## What's next? ##

Build a camera app.
